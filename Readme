Type in some text and it will tell you if it's a haiku.

Uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary for English:
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

Planned/potential updates:
 * should be upserting syllable info into the dictionary, not saving new records
 * spanish version
 * fuzzy haiku matching -- if we can't determine the syllables in a word, say "maybe" instead of NO

recent updates:
  * show recent haikus
  * feedback to let me know when it's wrong
  * guess syllabary for words not in the CMU dictionary (borrowed code from gem Lingua to do this)
