Type in some text and it will tell you if it's a haiku.

Uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary for English:

Planned/potential updates:
 * spanish version
 * guess syllabary for words not in the CMU dictionary (the gem Lingua can do this)
 * fuzzy haiku matching -- if we can't determine the syllables in a word, say "maybe" instead of NO
 * feedback to let me know when it's wrong
 * show recent haikus
